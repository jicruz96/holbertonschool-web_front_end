# Front-End Web Development

This repository contains _some_ projects from the Web Front-End section of the Holberton School Full-Stack Web Development specialization curriculum.

**Note: I am not a WebDev major, I am a Low-Level Systems major ([see repository for that major here](https://github.com/jicruz96/holbertonschool-system_linux)). But I had some extra time on my hands, so I chose to try to "double major"-- even though the school doesn't allow that-- by asking for access to the project content from my peers.**
